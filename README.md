# React Native Practice
## by Jason Andrada

A very barebones initial commit to begin a React Native app that will eventually hit the Oxford Dictionary API to generate word lists, thesaurus entries and definitions for user-input words

Wordlist functionality is live (but there is no styling), currently working through thesaurus functionality and routing.

Converted from Create React Native App to standard react-native init project
